# AI Code Assistant ðŸª„

LiveCodes supports AI-powered code completion, totally for **free**, using [Codeium](https://codeium.com/), the ultrafast Copilot alternative.

The large generative machine learning model is capable of understanding the context of your code and comments in order to generate suggestions on what you might want to type next.

It has a wide range of language support, and it works everywhere (in the [standalone app](../getting-started.md#standalone-app), [embedded playgrounds](./embeds.md) and [self-hosted](./self-hosting.md) apps).

## Examples:

JavaScript:

<video controls style={{width: '100%'}}>

  <source src="/docs/vid/LiveCodes-AI.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Python:

<video controls style={{width: '100%'}}>

  <source src="/docs/vid/LiveCodes-AI-py.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## Instructions

1. Install [Codeium chrome extension](https://codeium.com/chrome_tutorial).
2. Login to Codeium.
3. Enjoy the magic!

Currently, only [Monaco editor](./editor-settings.md#code-editor) on desktop Chrome browser is supported. Wider editor and browser support is planned.

:::caution Note

Please note that codeium extension sends your code to their servers for code completion. However, your code is not used for training their model.
